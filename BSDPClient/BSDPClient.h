/* 
 * BSDP Image Description Dictionary
 *
 * Each BSDP image description dictionary contains the keys
 * "Name", "Identifier", and "Index".  An image description may 
 * optionally contain any or all of the keys "IsDefault", 
 * "IsSelected", and "IsInstall".
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1) If multiple servers report an image whose "Identifier" is not local to the
 *    server, and the "Identifier" values are equal, they can be treated as the
 *    same image.  See BSDPImageDescriptionIdentifierIsServerLocal()
 *    defined below.
 * 2) "IsDefault" means the image is the default for this server.
 * 3) "IsSelected" means the image is the image that the client currently
 *    has a binding for with this server. Usually, just a single server
 *    will report a single image with this property, but if a server that
 *    had been off the network for awhile is suddenly placed on the 
 *    network again, more than one server may report this.

 *
 *   If the "Identifier" for an image is server local, the image must be

 * Purpose:

 *   available, and is provided with an array of image description
 *   dictionaries.  This array must NOT be released.
 *   See the "BSDP Image Description Dictionary" discussion above.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   client	the BSDPClientRef allocated using Create
 *   status	the status of the List operation
 *   list	an array of image description dictionaries,
 *              must NOT be CFRelease()'d
 *   info	the caller-supplied opaque handle supplied to BSDPClientList()
 *
 * Note:
 *   It's possible that duplicate responses may be received due to loops
 *   in the network.  It is the caller's responsibility to update
 *   its accumulated list appropriately in this case.  One simple strategy
 *   is to remove any existing image description dictionaries with the
 *   given ServerAddress before accumulating any new ones.

 * Function: BSDPClientList
 *
 * Purpose:

 *
 *   When a response arrives, decode it and build an array of BSDP image
 *   description dictionaries (see discussion above), and pass it to the
 *   callback.
 *
 *   If no responses arrive after 1 minute of trying, or some other
 *   error occurs, the callback is called with the appropriate status.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   client		The client handle created using BSDPClientCreate().
 *   callback		The function to call when image information is
 *  			available, or when an error occurs.
 *   info		The caller-supplied argument to pass to the callback.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   kBSDPClientStatusOK if List process started successfully.
 *   If an error occurred, some other status is returned.

 *   ServerAddress	The ServerAddress value suppled to the list
